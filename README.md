# Website Starter Template

This is a starter template to develop a website using a basic HTML/CSS/JS stack.

The template is bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and has a structure that allows to work with SCSS to
handle the website styles implementing a **custom** architecture based on
the [7-1 pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern).

## Getting started

To use the template as a starter for a new project you can press on the "_Use this template_" button on the top of the
page.

If you want to clone the repository you can do it with the following command:

```
